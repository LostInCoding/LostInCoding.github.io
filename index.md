# felix w√∂stmann

### I'm a _Computer Science student_ with a passion for _politics_.



  In my spare time I like to tinker around with software, read non-fiction books, listen extensively to podcasts and trying to _create some on my own_.

  My favorite way to get from A to B is my Pennyboard. I consider myself a _European_. On the internet I go by the name of _lostincoding_.
