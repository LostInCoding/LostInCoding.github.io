### I'm a _Computer Science student_ with a passion for _politics_



  In my spare time I like to tinker around with Software, listen extensively to podcasts (also trying to make one) and engaging in the _Pirateparty_.

  My favorite way to get from A to B is my Pennyboard. I consider myself an _European_.
